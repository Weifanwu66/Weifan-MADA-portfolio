The plot that I try to reproduce here is from [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marriage-isnt-dead-yet/). The marriage isn't dead-yet. It depicts the divorce rates by education in the age group from 35 to 44

setup

```{r}
library(ggtext)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
import data and glimpse data
```{r}
dataLocation=here("marriage","divorce.csv")
rawData=read.csv(dataLocation)
glimpse(rawData)
```
data wrangling
```{r}
#select the columns that contain the information that we need for plotting, which is year, HS_3544, SC_3544, and BAp_3544
edu_div=rawData%>%
  select(c(2,5:7))
#reshape the dataset, combine all the educational levels under "educational_level" variable and their respective values under "divorce" variable
edu_div1=edu_div%>%
  gather(key="education_level",value="divorce",2:4)
edu_div1
#remove strings "_3544" since we have already chosen the age groups beforehand, recode the levels to make table more intuitive, And mutate divorce rate to percentage
edu_div2=edu_div1%>%
  mutate(education_level=str_replace(string=education_level,pattern="_3544",replacement=""))%>%
  mutate(education_level=recode(education_level,"HS"="High school or less","SC"="Some college", "BAp"="College graduates"))%>%
  mutate(divorce=divorce*100)
edu_div2
```
Plotting
```{r}
#creating a data frame that will be used for plotting the names of education levels
education_level_labels=edu_div2%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from="year",values_from="divorce")%>%
  mutate(nrow=1:n(), #create a new column indicating which row each education level is at
         year=if_else(nrow%%2==0,"1990","1980"),#modulus function %% tells you the remainder, if the row is a even number (some college), we will take 1994,otherwise take 1985
         divorce=if_else(nrow%%2==0,`1990`,`1980`))%>% 
  select(education_level,year,divorce)
education_level_labels%>%
  mutate(year=)
```

```{r}
